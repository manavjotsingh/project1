# Project 1 Aloha

### My first website project for a clothing company;

This was my first project using any kind of coding language. I had trouble with both html and css in the same way. I understood the things I was taught and tried to use whatever I learned daily to try to do everything. Eventually I learned that learn more make it later.

## Personal Learning

* have patience and do not try to fix everything with a few things I have learned. Everthing has a intended use, you can strech and be creative but you can not do everything.

* trying to be to dry before you make it work. I learned first to make it work then make it better

* try to learn as much as possible daily but it might not click till you have enough practice with it or you see more aspect of the coding language.

## Technologies used

* Used HTML to setup the skeleton of the website and with it give classes and ID for the other coding languages.

* Used CSS to position, color and add background images.

* flexbox allowed me to position everything relative to each other by making all the div/sections/elements of the HTML into boxes.

* implimented custom fonts so each computer/browser can use them and have it look as intended.

* learned about command line, git and github, to save our projects. Very handy for saving in stages and sharing.

* implimented flickity which is made in JS to get the carousel effect. 

* also used Javascript to impliment what I learned with tree clicker and the if else to add a response to email submission and cart counter.
